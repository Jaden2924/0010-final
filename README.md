# 0010-final
Final project for Big Ideas in Computer and Information Science

The goal of this project is to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on a metric of our choosing. 

The metric we chose for this project was the neighborhood with the best chance of having multi-sport athletes live there.

We chose datasets including rinks, courts, fields, and pools in order to get the list of places to exercise in the neighborhoods surrounding Pittsburgh. After we got the top three, we gave them a score out of 15 points and the one with the most points won.
